### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Why I liked lab 1 is because it was a new coding experience for me. I never had to code with a terminal or VS code before. Coding like how we do now is more helpful than how I used to code during high school.

* Lab 2

I liked Lab 2 a lot because it reminded me of a project I did in high school so I had some experience. Although it was a learning jump from creating a header in Lab 1, it was still a good assingment to allow me to get commfortable with the way we code.

* Lab 3

Although Lab 3 was quite challenging but I enjoyed it. Me and my partner struggled during the process of how to structure the code. Luckily our notes allowed us complete it.
